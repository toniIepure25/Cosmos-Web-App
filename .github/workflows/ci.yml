Based on the provided project structure and metadata, I'll create a CI configuration using GitHub Actions to build and test the static web application within a Docker environment. Since there is no build tool specified, and it relies on Docker, we'll use Docker-related steps and validating configurations with `docker-compose`.

Here's a CI configuration YAML file that aligns with your specifications:


# FILENAME: .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-test-docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # ENVIRONMENT SETUP
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

    # LINTING/STAGE (Alternative step due to lack of traditional linter)
    - name: Validate Dockerfile syntax
      uses: docker/dockerfile-lint-action@v1
      with:
        file: Dockerfile

    - name: Validate Docker Compose syntax
      run: docker-compose config
      # QUALITY GATE: Fails on invalid configuration

    # BUILD STAGE
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t nginx-static-website .
      # QUALITY GATE: Fails on build errors

    # TEST STAGE
    - name: Test Docker Compose configuration
      run: docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose down
      # QUALITY GATE: Fails on runtime errors

    # POST-TEST CLEANUP
    - name: Clean up Docker images
      run: docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes --remove-orphans
    
    # COMMENT: The steps validate Dockerfile syntax, ensure the docker-compose file is valid, build the Docker image, and test by running the composed services, then cleanup.


### Notes:

1. **Environment Setup**: The Docker environment is set up using the `setup-buildx-action`, which helps leverage multi-platform Docker builds (even though not explicitly needed here, it's a good practice).

2. **Linting Alternative**: Since there are no traditional source code linters for JavaScript, HTML, or CSS mentioned, the steps validate Dockerfile and Docker Compose configurations instead.

3. **Build Stage**: The Docker image is built from the Dockerfile using the standard Docker build command.

4. **Test Stage**: Involves spinning up the Docker Compose defined services to ensure they run and then immediately tearing them down to verify runtime validity without leaving resources running.

5. **Post-Test Cleanup**: This cleans up any resources or artifacts created during the test stages.

6. **Timeout**: The entire workflow is protected by a 30-minute timeout to ensure that it doesn't run indefinitely due to unforeseen issues.
