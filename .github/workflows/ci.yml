Based on the provided information, the project appears to be a static website served by Nginx and containerized using Docker, orchestrated with Docker Compose. The CI configuration will therefore focus on building the Docker image and validating the Docker Compose configuration. Here's a YAML configuration suitable for that setup:


# FILENAME: .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-and-validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
  
    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
      
    - name: Cache Docker layers
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: /tmp/.buildx-cache
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-${{ github.sha }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-
          
    # BUILD STAGE
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build . -t nginx-static-website
      # QUALITY GATE: Fails on build errors

    # VALIDATION STAGE
    - name: Validate Docker Compose configuration
      run: docker-compose config
      # QUALITY GATE: Fails on invalid configuration

    # OPTIONAL: ADDITIONAL CHECKS
    # If more detailed testing is available or required, such as unit or integration tests, they should be included here.



### Configuration Details:
- **Checkout Code**: Uses GitHub's checkout action to clone the repository.
- **Docker Setup**: Uses the Docker Buildx action to set up Docker for building images.
- **Caching**: Caches Docker layers to accelerate subsequent builds.
- **Build Stage**: Builds the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
- **Validation Stage**: Validates the Docker Compose configuration to ensure there are no syntax errors or misconfigurations.
- **Timeout**: The job is limited to 30 minutes to avoid excessive runtime due to potential issues.

This configuration captures the essential steps for building and validating a Docker-based static web application. Based on the high confidence level, it adheres closely to the provided CI/CD recommendations and leverages GitHub Actions.
